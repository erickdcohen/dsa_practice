## Cracking the Coding Interview

Book with programming questions and solutions. Recommends going through various data structures and algorithms before jumping into the problems

1. Linked Lists

1. Sliding Window 

Use a hash table with two pointers to see what has already been seen to satisfy the condition

leetcode problem examples: 3, 424, 1876, 76

2. Two Pointers

Can involve sorting a list; use two pointers to solve

leetcode problem examples: 11, 15, 125

## General Tips

- Take your time to read the question. Comment your code as you go.
- Think about edge cases, ask the interviewer what the contraints are which can give you hints to the solution and think about edge cases
- If you are stuck, it's ok to discuss the naive/brute force way to think about it to start.
